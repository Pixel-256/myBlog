***<font size=5>What's the difference between "aim for" and "aim at"?</font>***  
![](image/2021-07-02-23-06-07.png)
* "Aim for" is trying to get *yourself* somewhere.
* "Aim at" is trying to get *something* somewhere.

**The details**: 
Aim for:
This phrase is usually all about personal goal setting. We often use it to talk about our ultimate/final goal.
>*I'm going to **aim for** full marks. I can do it!*
>
>*He is **aiming for** the stars*

We can also aim for a date when we’re making plans with people:
>*Let's **aim for** the 28th to finish the project.*

Aim at:
“Aim at” can generally be used in two ways. Both ways are about getting something somewhere.

The first way is quite aggressive and is about attacking something or someone. We often think about guns with this verb, but also about personal attacks:
>*He **aimed** his anger **at** his boss.*
>
>*Try to **aim at** the center of the target.*

The second way we can use this phrase is in advertising or media. We talk about how a product, project, TV show or band can be aimed at a certain type of customer/audience:
>*This course is **aimed at** higher-level students.*
>
>*I think fast food adverts that are **aimed at** children should be banned.*
